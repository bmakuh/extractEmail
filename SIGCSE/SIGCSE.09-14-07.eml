Subject: C and OpenGL in Ubuntu

I would like to try using C and OpenGL in Ubuntu for my CG class. I am not familiar with how to set C and OpenGL up in Ubuntu. I am starting from a straight install of Ubuntu 7. Is anyone using this setup who would be willing to send me a handout giving instructions on installing the correct student environment?

Thanks in advance,

Gary
