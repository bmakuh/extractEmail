CALL FOR PAPERS

GDCSE=9208, The Third Annual Microsoft Academic Days Conference on Game =20=

Development in Computer Science Education

February 28-March 3, 2008
On board the Celebrity Century cruise ship, departing from Miami, FL

Submissions deadline:  October 15, 2007
Conference Paper Submissions:  http://gdcse2008.confmaster.net

GDCSE =9108 =96 the Third Annual Microsoft Academic Days Conference on =20=

Game Development in Computer Science Education =96 is a focal point for =20=

academic efforts using computer and console games within the Computer =20=

Science curriculum.  Jointly sponsored by Microsoft Research and =20
Electronic Arts, the conference is targeted at both computer science =20
educators and researchers, promoting new efforts in the creation and =20
management of courses and curriculum using game development.  The =20
conference, now in its third year, will be held aboard the Celebrity =20
Century cruise ship, departing from and returning to Miami, FL with =20
port calls in Key West and Cozumel, Mexico. GDCSE=9208 will include =20
talks by invited speakers, presentation of peer-reviewed papers, =20
hands-on tutorials and birds-of-a-feather meetings focusing on a =20
range of topics related to the use of games in computer science =20
education. We invite researchers and educators to share insights and =20
cutting edge results relating to the use of games and game =20
technologies in both formal and informal educational contexts.

PAPERS

All submissions will be evaluated for their technical merit, =20
significance, clarity and their relevance both to researchers =20
interested in the efficacy of games-based instruction and to faculty =20
interested in the design of courses and programs that make use of =20
games. All papers must show rigorous and compelling evaluation of the =20=

ideas they present. Topics should be explicitly related to the use of =20=

game development in Computer Science Education, including but not =20
limited to:

o The design, execution and integration of game development classes =20
within the Computer Science major.

o The use of game development projects in traditional Computer =20
Science classes.

o Game development courses as capstone projects.

o Interdisciplinary collaboration with non-CS disciplines (both for =20
students and for faculty).

o Game development concentrations and majors.

o Laboratory and infrastructure requirements for game development =20
classes.

o The effect of game development classes on the Computer Science =20
student.

All accepted paper submissions will be published in the conference =20
proceedings, which will be available on CD, and will also be included =20=

in the ACM Digital Library.  Expanded versions of top papers from the =20=

proceedings will be selected to appear in a special issue of the =20
Journal of Game Development.  For a paper to appear in the =20
proceedings, at least one author must register for the conference by =20
the deadline for camera-ready copy submission.  Travel costs for one =20
author of each accepted paper will be provided by Microsoft, =20
including round-trip airfare to Miami as well as conference and =20
cruise ship registration costs.  Specific restrictions apply for =20
government employees and faculty from US Public Universities. Consult =20=

the conference web site (www.microsoft4me.com/faculty/events/=20
adgd2008) for further details.

Electronic paper submission is required. Specific submission =20
instructions are available at the GDCSE web site.  Paper authors must =20=

submit their papers by 11PM Pacific time on October 15, 2007.  Papers =20=

must not exceed five pages and must comply with the official ACM =20
proceedings format using one of the templates provided at http://=20
www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html.  GDCSE 08 will not =20
accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for =20=

or has already been published or accepted for publication in a =20
journal or another conference. This restriction does not apply to =20
submissions for workshops and other venues with a limited audience.

IMPORTANT DATES

-          October 15, 2007: Electronic submission of papers due by =20
11PM Pacific time.

-          November 18, 2007: Notification of acceptance sent to authors

-          January 8, 2008: Camera-ready copy due

Subject: ACM Java library

I'm teaching CS1 with the ACM Java library for the second time this fall.

Do you have any feel for the popularity of the library in the
introductory curriculum and will presentations on the subject be part of
next year's SIGCSE?
