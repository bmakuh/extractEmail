Subject: XNA in CS classes

Hey all,
=20
I'm mulling around some ideas to change my classes, and I've stumbled =
across Microsoft's XNA Framework. I was wondering if anyone else has =
tried this already and what they might recommend. Success stories? =
Failure stories? Textbook options? I find the possibility of having =
students write to XBox particularly interesting, especially in how it =
might attract more students to the program.
=20
I'll summarize if there's interest.

Thanks,
