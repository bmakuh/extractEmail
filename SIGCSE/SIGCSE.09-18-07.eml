                     CCSC Eastern 2007 Conference
                         October 12-13, 2007
                 St. Joseph's College, Patchogue, NY
                      http://www.sjcny/ccsce2007

We hope you are all set and ready to join us for what promises to be a
very worthwhile conference. Because of the late starting date of some
schools and the holidays last week, we have extended the deadlines to
September 21st, so you have until this Friday to take advantage of the
early bird registration rates.

    Don't miss out--get your registration in this week!
    Check the website for registration forms and travel details!


Also, you can still submit a Faculty or Student Poster or enter a
Programming Competition team until September 21st.  We are still
accepting session chairs and poster and programming competition
judges. Even if you are already a presenter, if you would like to
assist with any of these things, just send me an email indicating your
preferences.

Submissions for the "Nifty Ideas" and "Lightning Talks" sessions are
now closed.

We look forward to meeting all of you in October!

Subject: Logic Programming and Expert Systems Course Textbook Suggestions

About 10 months ago I requested suggestions for textbooks or text materials
for a course on "Logic Programming and Expert Systems" that I planned to
revive (after more than a decade of dormancy).  Not being an AI person, I
planned to focus more on the programming and software engineering aspects.

For various reasons, I had to delay the offering of the course from the 2007
Fall semester (August-December) until the 2008 Spring semester (January-May).
So I am again looking at textbooks.

The book suggested by several responses was Ivan Bratko's Prolog Programming
for Artificial Intelligence, Third Edition, 2001, from Addison-Wesley in the
UK.  After a bit of pushing on my AW rep here in the US, I got an examination
copy of the book from the US distributor for the UK AW books or something
such.

The Bratko book seems to be good.  However, I have a few questions yet.

(1) The website for the Bratko book seems long gone.  Are there any support
materials for use of the book such as slides, electronic copies of the
programs, etc?

(2) Although not extremely expensive as contemporary books go at US$76, it is
still a bit costly, especially if I only want to use it for about half of the
course and other materials for the "expert systems" part.  I note a free
online book called Learn Prolog Now (also available in print for US$25).
Does anyone have experience using that book?  Or other inexpensive
alternatives?

(3) I am interpreting the "expert systems" part to be "rule-based programming"
and (probably) plan to emphasize issues like building business rules bases.
I am considering using either JESS or JBoss Rules for this part.  I know
there is a programming book on JESS by its developer.  I can't find any book
on JBoss Rules (or Drools as it was previously called).  I was wondering if
anyone has attempted to use either of these for a class.  Are there any
teaching materials for either?

Thanks.
