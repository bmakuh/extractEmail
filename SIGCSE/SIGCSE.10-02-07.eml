Subject: Damage control: What to do when things don't work

What should you do when your software breaks, when your labs don't work out,
when your tests are bombed, when your homework has errors?  These are questions
every instructor has faced.

Inspired by the SIGCSE 2007 panel on "Teaching Tips We Wish They'd Told Us
Before We Started," I'm interested in gathering tips and techniques to share
with new engineering educators at next year's ASEE conference.  I'd be
interested in hearing from you if you ...

-- have any techniques or anecdotes to mention,
-- have seen any other articles on the subject, or
-- know of other listservs where I could post the same query.

I think this survey could turn out to be a great resource.  I know I could often
use it myself!

I will, of course, be happy to share my conclusions with this list, either when
the paper is finished next January, or piecemeal earlier upon request.

Thanks,
Ed

Subject: flash in cs education

Last week I sent a question about uses of Flash in CS Education.
Here is what I learned.  I have attached the individual examples
below, listed approximately in chronological order of their arrival.

None stated a particular textbook, several said they are still
looking for a good textbook to use in their classes.  There were
several others who were interested in the topic too. Enjoy.


Lakshmi Prayaga
University of West Florida
Uses it in Intro to game programming Course and finds it extreemly
good. Students are very motivated because it is an integrated
environment meaning you can both design and write the code in 1
place. Also uses it in summer camps which is again very successful.

Timothy T. Yuen (Doctoral Candidate)
The University of Texas at Austin
Has taught Flash/ActionScript to children as a way to teach game
making.  It seemed to work well with the children since visualization
of the code (through the symbols) was pretty inherent in the
projects. Studying uses of Flash to teach OO, for more details on his
dissertation see http://www.csnub.com.

Scott Leutenegger
University at Denver
Paper at SIGCSE 2007 (A games first approach to teaching introductory
programming) about his use of Flash and ActionScript in his "Games
First" CS1 class. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1227310.1227352. Another
publication at CCSC in 2006. His website is available at http://
www.cs.du.edu/~leut/.

Bill Hochstettler
Franklin University
Franklin University is using it in a course on animation for the web.

Ursula Wolz
The College of New Jersey
ActionScript is used in their introductory course CSC 101 which is
cross-listed with Interactive Multimedia as IMM 120. The course is
called "Introduction to Interactive Computing."

John Barr
Ithaca College
Ithaca College offers a course for non-majors on Flash development
including actionscript.  They are considering a gaming minor which
would include this course.

Eric Sedgwick
DePaul University
They just started doing this, using ActionScript for intro
programming for their Interactive Multimedia program.

Subject: Re: flash in cs education

Manuel -- I somehow missed your original posting on this. Thank you
for the summary!

In the Software Engineering course I taught at UT Austin from 1997 to
2006, many teams used Flash to create software to meet the needs of
their clients (the required project was often educational software).
The nature of this SWE class required each team to figure out the
skills they needed to complete their projects and how to best acquire
those skills if they did not have them. Unfortunately, the course
site has been deactivated but I will plan to search through and list
out resources teams recommended as helpful while they came up to
speed with Flash.

A seemingly tricky issue is how to make Flash accessible. A former
student of mine, Thea Eaton, has founded a company to create
accessible software for pre-college settings. During a panel on
accessibility that I organized for the Austin chapter of IEEE Women
in Engineering, Thea explained how to make Flash accessible. Her talk
combined content and presentation by means of an accessible Flash
show. Thea's presentation, as well as information from the other
panelists, are at the URL http://austin-wie.org/minutes/minutes-
centex-wie-060920.htm

Regards,
