Subject: Computer Architecture Text for InfoSys majors

Dear Colleagues,

I will be teaching a Computer Structures course for our Information Systems
majors next term (Winter 2008).

I would be interested in your recommendations for a textbook.
I would appreciate if you could share your syllabus and experience as well.

The course is intended to be an introduction to computer architecture for
students in their 2-3 year. I hope to find a textbook that specifically
targets InfoSys majors.

Please reply directly to me. I will post a summary if there is an interest.

Thank you and best regards to all,

Anatole
