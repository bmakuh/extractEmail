Subject: Electronic Commerce Text for InfoSys majors

Dear Colleagues,

I will be teaching an Electronic Commerce course for our Information Systems
majors next term (Winter 2008).

I would be interested in your recommendations of a textbook.
I would appreciate if you could share your syllabus and experience as well.

The Electronic Commerce course is intended to be a senior level course but
we expect a few well-prepared nonmajors and lower-level students to join as
well.

Please reply directly to me. I will post a summary if there is an interest.

Thank you and best regards to all,

Anatole
