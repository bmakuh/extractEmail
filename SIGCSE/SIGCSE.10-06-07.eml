Subject: Tenure-Track Position in Computer Science at Grinnell College

The Department of Computer Science at Grinnell College announces the
availability of a tenure-track position starting in Fall 2008.

Assistant Professor (Ph.D.) preferred; Instructor (ABD) or Associate
Professor possible. Area open.

Grinnell College is a highly selective undergraduate liberal arts college
that supports and encourages a faculty of active scholars whose primary
mission is to teach. Faculty at the College place a high value on
interaction with students, both in and out of classes, and in a wide range
of scholarly activities.  Grinnell's CS faculty delight in innovative
pedagogy, and applications are strongly encouraged from scholars who have a
strong interest in collaborative learning techniques, lab-based courses,
and creative pedagogy.

The College's curriculum is founded on a strong advising system and close
student-faculty interaction, with few college-wide requirements beyond the
completion of a major. Candidates with an ability to teach courses that
serve one of the College's interdisciplinary concentrations (e.g.,
Technology Studies, Policy Studies, Global Development Studies,
Neuroscience) or interdisciplinary themes (e.g., Peace, Social Justice, and
Sustainability; Interdisciplinary Art) will receive special
consideration. The teaching schedule of five courses over two semesters
will include a range of introductory and upper-level computer science
courses and, in some years, courses that reach out to other disciplines;
every few years one course will be Tutorial (a writing/critical thinking
course for first-year students, oriented toward a special topic).

In letters of application, candidates should discuss their interest in
developing as a teacher and scholar in an undergraduate, liberal-arts
environment that emphasizes close student-faculty interaction. They should
also address how they can contribute to efforts to cultivate a wide
diversity of people and perspectives, a core value of Grinnell College.

To be assured of full consideration, all application materials should be
received by November 1, 2007. Send cover letter, curriculum vitae, a
teaching statement, a research statement, and transcripts, and arrange for
three confidential letters of recommendation to be sent to: Professor Henry
Walker, Department of Computer Science, Grinnell College, Grinnell, IA
50112-1690 CS2007@cs.grinnell.edu; 641-269-4208; fax 641-269-4285.

Grinnell College is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer
committed to attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals who
collectively reflect the diversity of the nation. No applicant shall be
discriminated against on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, age,
gender, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, creed, or
disability. For further information about Grinnell College, see our Web
site at www.grinnell.edu. For further information about the Computer
Science Department, see our Web site at http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/.
