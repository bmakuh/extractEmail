From:    Wanda Kunkle <wanda.m.kunkle@DREXEL.EDU>
Subject: Programming tools for teaching K-12 computer science

Hello, all,

My name is Wanda Kunkle. I regularly teach Computer Science at the
college level and tutor AP Computer Science on a part-time basis. I am
also a Ph.D. student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. I am
posting this announcement at Steve Cooper's encouragement because I
would like your help with a research project I am involved in at
Drexel. A description of the project is posted on the CSTA Web site at
http://csta.acm.org/Resources/sub/Announcements.html . (It's the second
announcement addressing software development tools that teachers use.)

I would genuinely appreciate your help if you are interested.

Thanks, in advance,
