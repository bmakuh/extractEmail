Subject: Virginia IT Workforce Summit

For those of you in Virginia, in the mid-Atlantic region, or perhaps with a
strong interest in IT workforce issues, you may want to attend the Virginia
IT Workforce Summit in Culpepper Virginia on Wednesday, November 7th.  This
event is bringing together representatives from government, industry, and
academia to discuss some of the causes of, and possible solutions for, the
national and regional decline in IT enrollments and the associated
difficulties in deploying a qualified IT workforce.

Issues to be discussed include but are not limited to:

-  Lack of female participation
-  Heavy percentage of workforce retraining
-  Image of IT professionals
-  Role of high school IT programs
-  Attracting experienced professionals and IT retirees back into the
workforce
-  IT Farm-shoring in Virginia

The one-day Summit, including a presentation by Virginia Secretary of
Technology Aneesh Chopra, and a dinner keynote address by Scott McKay, Vice
President and CIO of Genworth Financial, will be held at:

Germanna Community College
Germanna Center for Advanced Technology
18121 Technology Drive
Culpeper, Virginia 22701

For more information about the event and to register for the Summit, visit

For those of you in Virginia and the surrounding region, please feel free to
share this invitation with industry, government, and academic partners.
