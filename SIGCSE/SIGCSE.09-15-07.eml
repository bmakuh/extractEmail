Subject: OOPSLA Educators Symposium special session

If you are planning to attend the OOPSLA Educators Symposium in Montreal, =
please continue to read this note.

A special 90-minute session is scheduled called "Nifty CS1 Frenzy".  There =
are quite a few products in the CS education community that attempt to =
make it easier or better to teach CS1 with objects.  Each of these =
products has the following in  common:
1. They are free (no licensing fees or purchase price)
2. They have a very easy learning curve
3. They make it easy to do "nifty" things with objects in CS1

Many of us have attended "Nifty Assignment" sessions, where people present =
assignments that are interesting for both the students and the instructors.=
  But when we attend these sessions, we watch someone talk about the =
assignment and display the results.  At least for part of the time at a =
professional conference, the audience members should be more involved than =
that.  So in THIS session, it will be the audience members who end up =
presenting the "nifty" CS1 assignments that they just programmed using a =
product that, for them, is somewhat new.

Here are the rules.  A number of products (some possible examples: Alice, =
BlueJ, Greenfoot, JPT, Karel) will be available at various stations with =
instructors and/or helpers.  There will also be some assignments that =
would be typically used in CS1.  Everyone will be encouraged to join a =
pair or small group that will learn to use a product well enough to solve =
one of the assignments.  In 45 minutes.  Then, during the last 30 minutes, =
people who solved their assignment may present the results of their =
experience to the entire group.

If you would like to be the representative (proponent) for a CS1 product =
at the OOPSLA Eductors Symposium in Montreal on October 22 this year, =
please contact me as soon as possible.  Let me know what product you wish =
to have involved in the special session, and a web site that has further =
information on the product.  You will need to have sample problems that a =
highly intelligent CS educator (who has never used the product before) =
would be able to solve within 45 minutes.  You do not need to send me =
those problems, however.
