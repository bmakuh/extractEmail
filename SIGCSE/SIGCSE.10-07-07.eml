Subject: CFP: SIGCSE 2008 Doctoral Consortium

                       Call for participation
                    Doctoral Consortium at SIGCSE 2008
                           March 12, 2008

The SIGCSE Doctoral Consortium (DC) is an annual event designed to
benefit Ph.D. students in computing-related areas who are planning a
career in academia. Students pursuing research related to computing
education are a primary focus. The DC is a full-day workshop (8:30am
through dinner) held the day before the regular sessions of the SIGCSE
Technical Symposium begin. Those wishing to attend must first apply by
November 7, 2007. Travel support for participation is available for
attendees. For application information, see:
   http://depts.washington.edu/sigcsedc/

The aims of the Doctoral Consortium are:
         * To offer a friendly forum for students to discuss their work
        and receive constructive feedback so as to advance each
        student's research.
         * To provide relevant information on issues important to
        doctoral candidates.
         * To nurture a community of researchers in computing
        education.

The Consortium is designed for students currently enrolled in a
Ph.D. program. The Consortium allows participants to interact with
established university researchers in computing education (the
discussants) and with other PhD students, and to reflect -- through
short activities, information sessions, and discussions -- on the
process and lessons of research and life in academia.
