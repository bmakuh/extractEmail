Subject: Re: Teaching with wikis

Last month, I posted a request on this forum for members to tell me =20
how they have used wikis in teaching.  Here is a summary of what =20
others reported.

By far the most extensive use of wikis was reported by Mark Guzdial, =20
who in 2000 and 2001, wrote two papers on the use of his CoWeb, =20
essentially a wiki, in over 120 courses at Georgia Tech.  The two =20
papers are http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?=20
id=3D377452&dl=3Dacm&coll=3Dportal
and
http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?=20
id=3D358997&coll=3DGUIDE&dl=3DGUIDE&CFID=3D25482559&CFTOKEN=3D35869214

Among the uses he cited were creating pages with bookmarks to Web =20
sites in a "ubiquitous computing" course; in a course on digital =20
video effects, case studies on effects in current movies and =20
generated story boards; and "case libraries," in which students =20
create information sources and advice for future students.

A number of faculty have used wikis for class discussions.  Lynn =20
Andrea Stein, at Olin, has used wikis for a variety of purposes, from =20=

signup sheets to participatory discussions.  John Dougherty, of =20
Haverford, used a wiki to have students reflect on the advantages and =20=

consequences of technologies in a "Fluency with IT" course.  Tom =20
Naps, at UW-Oshkosh, has used wikis in an ethics course to have =20
students answer discussion questions and react to classmates' postings.

Tom Wulf, at Cincinnati, has used a wiki for students to post Linden =20
Scripting Language code for Second Life.  William Joel, at Western =20
Connecticut State, has used wikis to create a display for =93Living in =20=

a Digital World."  Laurie White, at Mercer, uses wikis in a =20
Programming Languages course.  At the end of the course, she has the =20
students do a group project where they learn a new language as a =20
group, applying concepts learned in the class.  These projects are =20
shared with the class using a wiki.

Personally, I have used a wiki in three courses:  In my ethics in =20
computing class, students worked on updates and additional articles =20
for our Ethics in Computing Web site (http://ethics.csc.ncsu.edu).  =20
This fall, I am using a wiki in an o-o design class.  Among other =20
things, I will have the students describe and catalog examples of =20
design patterns and principles available on the Web.  In my =20
Architecture of Parallel Computers class, students are helping to =20
update the textboook (Culler-Singh-Gupta), which is 9 years old, by =20
researching different sections and writing up their results, complete =20=

with hyperlinks to primary sources.

A few instructors reported negative experiences.  Paul Gestwicki, at =20
Ball State, experimented with wikis in a game development class.  =20
However, his students found a lot of material already on the Web, and =20=

found little advantage in creating another wiki.  Robert Adams, at =20
Grand Valley State, made wikis an optional forum for his class, where =20=

students were invited to expand on his lecture notes.  Unfortunately, =20=

no one did.  My own take on these experiments is that contributing to =20=

a wiki needs to be a graded activity in a class.  I have an internal =20
NCSU grant this year relating to assessment strategies for wikis.  If =20=

anyone is interested in participating, I would be happy to work with =20
you, even though you are not at NCSU.

Another concern is defacement of a wiki by outsiders.  This has been =20
a serious problem for a couple of instructors who responded to my =20
query.  The consensus is that wikis need to be backed up, and access =20
needs to be controlled.  One simple (though not very robust) way to =20
achieve this is not to post the URL of the wiki anywhere on the Web, =20
including the course Web site.

Subject: 2008 ASEE Annual Conference

American Society for Engineering Education
Software Engineering Constituent Committee
2008 Annual Conference Call for Papers and Reviewers


The ASEE Software Engineering Constituent Committee (SwECC) invites
papers for the 2008 ASEE annual conference. We will be accepting papers
related to all areas of software engineering education.  Papers in the
following topic areas are of particular interest: new looks at teaching
"classic" topics, such as, requirements, modeling, design, architecture,
verification and validation, maintenance and evolution, software
process, and formal methods; pedagogical approaches for teaching
"contemporary" topics, such as, engineering of secure software systems,
web-based systems, and software development in a globally distributed
environment; software engineering capstone experiences; software
engineering within multi-disciplinary capstone projects;  intellectual
property issues in industry-academic relationships; accreditation
experience reports; curriculum design using SwEBOK and the Software
Engineering volume; capitalizing on internship, co-operative work, or
study aboard experiences; integration of software engineering
undergraduate and graduate programs; and, mechanisms for individual and
team evaluation in team projects.

The two-step review process will consist of an abstract review followed,
if favorable, by a full manuscript review. Acceptance of the work at
both stages of review is necessary for presentation in SwECC sessions.
Abstracts are judged on level of innovation, technical merit,
demonstrated outcomes and relevance to software engineering education.
Full manuscripts will be judged on these same criteria as well as on
accuracy, completeness, readability and rigor of presentation. The SwECC
uses the publish-to-present rule for the annual conference. All
presenters are expected to register for and attend the conference. Each
abstract should be 250 - 500 words long. All abstracts must be submitted
through SmoothPaper, http://www.asee.org/SmoothPaper, which will open
for submissions on September 4, 2008.

This is also a solicitation for volunteers to review submitted abstracts
and papers.  If you can be a reviewer, please e-mail the SwEEC Program
Chair.

For more information or to volunteer as a reviewer, please contact the
2008 SwEEC Program Chair, Jim Vallino (J.Vallino@se.rit.edu,
585-475-2991); Department of Software Engineering; Rochester Institute
of Technology.
